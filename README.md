# Analysis Using Reproducible Environments

This git repository accompanies the reproducible environments talk. [Slides here](www.londonr.org/presentations/2015/11/LondonR_-_Reproducible_Environments_-_Doug_Ashton_-_20151130.pdf).

Each branch is a different example. The master branch is the full Docker example where not only is the code documented and reproducible, but the exact machine is also documented and reproducible.
